Pre-History
===========

One of the first implementations of CoAP under Python was also called CoAPy,
with the last public release 0.0.2 on July 22nd 2010 conformant to (perhaps)
draft 01 of the specification.  The committee soon changed the specification
so the implementation did not conform, and due to lack of value to the
sponsor `People Power Company <http://www.peoplepowerco.com>`_ the effort
was aborted.

The framework to which this documentation apply was developed from scratch
without reference to the previous implementation, and is asserted to not be
a derivative work.
